# Face-Mask-Detection-using-ResNet50
This project uses transfer learning with the ResNet50 model to develop an efficient face mask detection system. By leveraging pre-trained weights and data augmentation, the model accurately classifies images as masked or unmasked, contributing to public health and safety by ensuring mask-wearing compliance.
